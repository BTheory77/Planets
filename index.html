            <p class="info-left">Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun in our solar system. It orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 58 million kilometers (36 million miles), making it the innermost planet. Mercury is the smallest and innermost planet in our solar system. It is named after the Roman messenger god Mercury, known for his speed, which is fitting since Mercury has the shortest orbital period of any planet in the solar system. Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury experiences extreme temperature variations, with surface temperatures ranging from scorching hot to freezing cold.</p>

                Venus, often referred to as Earth's "sister planet," is the second planet from the Sun and orbits at an average distance of about 108 million kilometers (67 million miles). It is similar in size and composition to Earth, with a rocky surface and a thick atmosphere primarily composed of carbon dioxide. Venus is known for its extreme surface temperatures, reaching up to 471 degrees Celsius (880 degrees Fahrenheit), making it the hottest planet in the solar system. The planet's dense atmosphere traps heat, creating a runaway greenhouse effect. Despite its harsh conditions, Venus exhibits striking features such as vast volcanic plains, towering mountains, and dense cloud cover, making it a fascinating subject of study for scientists.

            <p class="info-right">Mars, the fourth planet from the Sun, orbits at an average distance of about 228 million kilometers (142 million miles). Known as the "Red Planet" due to its rusty reddish appearance, Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere primarily composed of carbon dioxide. It is home to the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, as well as Valles Marineris, one of the largest canyons. Mars has captured the imagination of scientists and the public alike as a potential target for future human exploration and colonization due to its similarities to Earth and the possibility of past or present life.

            <p class="info-left">Jupiter, the fifth planet from the Sun at an average distance of about 778 million kilometers (484 million miles), is the largest planet in our solar system. With its iconic banded appearance and Great Red Spot—a giant storm that has been raging for centuries—Jupiter is a gas giant composed primarily of hydrogen and helium. It has a strong magnetic field and numerous moons, including the four largest known as the Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Jupiter's immense size and gravitational influence play a crucial role in shaping the architecture of the solar system, acting as a cosmic vacuum cleaner that helps clear debris and stabilize the orbits of nearby planets.

                Saturn, the sixth planet from the Sun, orbits at an average distance of about 1.43 billion kilometers (888 million miles). Known for its magnificent ring system, Saturn is a gas giant composed mostly of hydrogen and helium. Its rings, made up of countless icy particles ranging in size from tiny grains to large chunks, are one of the most iconic features in the solar system. Saturn also boasts a diverse array of moons, with over 80 known satellites orbiting the planet. Its largest moon, Titan, is of particular interest due to its thick atmosphere and potential for hosting conditions conducive to life. Saturn's mesmerizing rings and intriguing moons make it a subject of fascination and exploration for scientists and space enthusiasts alike.

                Uranus, the seventh planet from the Sun, orbits at an average distance of about 2.88 billion kilometers (1.79 billion miles). It is a gas giant like Jupiter and Saturn but differs in its unique feature: it rotates on its side, with its axis almost parallel to its orbit around the Sun. This unusual orientation gives Uranus its distinct rolling motion as it orbits the Sun. Uranus is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with traces of methane in its atmosphere that give it a pale blue-green color. The planet has a system of faint rings and a retinue of moons, the most famous of which is Miranda, known for its diverse and fractured surface. Uranus remains a mysterious and intriguing world, with much left to discover about its composition, atmosphere, and formation.

                Neptune, the eighth planet from the Sun, is a distant gas giant that orbits at an average distance of about 4.5 billion kilometers (2.8 billion miles). Named after the Roman god of the sea, Neptune's striking blue hue comes from the presence of methane in its atmosphere. It boasts a dynamic atmosphere characterized by powerful storms, including the Great Dark Spot, a massive vortex reminiscent of Jupiter's Great Red Spot. Neptune also has a system of faint rings and a fascinating assortment of moons, with Triton, its largest moon, standing out for its retrograde orbit and icy surface geysers. Despite being the farthest planet from the Sun, Neptune continues to captivate scientists and stargazers alike with its intriguing features and mysteries waiting to be unraveled.
